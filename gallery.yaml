# Write a short, attention-grabbing description of your project.
desc: >
Our project is a fully functional HTTP web server built in OCaml, supporting GET, POST, and DELETE requests through a flexible routing system.
It offers a suite of text-processing endpoints, including uppercasing, reversing, capitalizing, and spell-checking with support for user-defined dictionaries.
A built-in Wordle game and a self-documenting help endpoint enhance interactivity, while server status metrics provide real-time diagnostics.

In addition to its web-facing interface, the server includes a local command-line mode that allows users to simulate HTTP requests directly from the terminal.
A lightweight CSV-based database supports adding, querying, and deleting records via API calls.
Designed for extensibility, the server uses Lwt for concurrency and includes comprehensive unit tests to ensure reliability.
