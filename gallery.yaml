# Write a short, attention-grabbing description of your project.

  Our project is a basic web server. It supports basic request handling for a
  set of pre-defined requests (TBD). Users will be able to make basic API 
  requests of text inputs. It will implement basic HTTP protocols and handle
  HTTP methods with a router.

  Simple visual support will be provided for inputs, while the format of
  outputs may vary.
